These files is a summary of all what I learned in python.

Starting with encode, this is something I heard in shool, about cipher method that was used years ago.
Cipher method is called "Cezar Cipher" or "Shift Cipher", meaning that each letter is assigned to another letter located a specified number of places later in the alphabet. I wanted to recreate this method in code.
