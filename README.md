# About
These files is a summary of all what I learned in python.

## Encode
Starting with encode, this is something I heard in shool, about cipher method that was used years ago.
Cipher method is called "Cezar Cipher" or "Shift Cipher", meaning that each letter is assigned to another letter located a specified number of places later in the alphabet. I wanted to recreate this method in code.

Messages contains 2 scripts that are connected by socket library witch uses internet connection and open ports to communicate with each other. This is how to make it work in 5 steps:
1. Make sure you have python and socket library installed
2. Open first messagesServer.py in console
3. Then second messagesClient.py in console
4. In the second console, the application asks for an IP address. If you do it locally, type: "127.0.0.0" (without quotes)
5. Type your username in second console, it can be anything.

And you done!
Now these scripts can talk to each other.
Open Third and Fourth messagesClient.py in console, connect them to the same network and test it as you want.
